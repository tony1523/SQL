## Problem Statement 
There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital only banks without physical branches. Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data worldâ€¦so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank! This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

## Dataset

### REGIONS
This regions table contains the region_id and their respective region_name values.
| region_id | region_name |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | Africa      |
| 2         | America     |

### CUSTOMER NODES
Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their region - this also specifies exactly which node contains both their cash and data.
Below is a sample of the top 10 rows of the data_bank.customer_nodes.
| customer_id | region_id | node_id | start_date | end_date   |

## Solutions
## A. Customer Nodes Exploration

```sql
WITH cte_num_nodes as (
SELECT DISTINCT cn.node_id
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes AS cn)
SELECT COUNT(node_id) AS number_unique_nodes
FROM cte_num_nodes;
```
| number_unique_nodes |
|---------------------|
| 5                   |

### 2. What is the number of nodes per region?
```sql
SELECT r.region_name,COUNT(cn.node_id) AS number_of_nodes
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes AS cn
JOIN data_bank.regions r on r.region_id=cn.region_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
| region_name | number_of_customers |
|-------------|---------------------|

### 4. How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(cn.end_date-cn.start_date),2) AS num_days
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes AS cn
WHERE cn.end_date != '9999-12-31';
```
| num_days |
|----------|
| 14.63    |

### 5. What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

SELECT cn.end_date-cn.start_date AS num_days
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes AS cn
WHERE cn.end_date != '9999-12-31')
SELECT  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY num_days) AS median,
		PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY num_days) AS "80th_percentile",
        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY num_days) AS "95th_percentile"
FROM cte_avg_days;
```
| median | 80th_percentile | 95th_percentile |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 15     | 23              | 28              |

FROM data_bank.customer_transactions AS ct
WHERE ct.txn_type='deposit'
GROUP BY 1)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(countamount),2) AS avg_deposit_count, ROUND(AVG(total_amount),2) AS avg_total_amount
FROM cte_avg_table;
```

sum(balance) over(PARTITION BY customer_id
ORDER BY month ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS closing_balance
